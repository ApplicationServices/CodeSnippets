### Contributing guidelines

##### 1. Include a header description for the submitted code
		A short and precise one liner

##### 2. Comment code lines in a meaningful and helpful way to enable others to reuse code. 
		More comments are always better than no comments

##### 3. Anonymize all code 
		There must be no references to usernames, computernames and/or customer names
  
##### 4. Master branch is protected, so all commits should be to a seperate branch
##### 5. All Pull requests require at least 1 Approving Review
